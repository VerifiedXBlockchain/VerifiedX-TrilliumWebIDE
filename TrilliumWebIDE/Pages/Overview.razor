                    Trillium Web IDE (tIDE) is an open-source web application for the VerifiedX VFX community to interact and develop with. 
                    Trillium fosters a fast runtime compilation and execution of code with a straight forward and intuitive GUI. 
                    tIDE can be used for the entire process of contract development as well as act as an intuitive environment for learning Trillium.
