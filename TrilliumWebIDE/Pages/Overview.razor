                    Trillium Web IDE (tIDE) is an open-source web application for the ReserveBlock RBX community to interact and develop with. 
                    Trillium fosters a fast runtime compilation and execution of code with a straight forward and intuitive GUI. 
                    tIDE can be used for the entire process of contract development as well as act as an intuitive environment for learning Trillium.

                <p>
                    Trillium was designed with NFTs specifically in mind and is a Turing complete language. 
                    Trillium IDE is the driving force smart contract language of the ReserveBlock RBX Project.
