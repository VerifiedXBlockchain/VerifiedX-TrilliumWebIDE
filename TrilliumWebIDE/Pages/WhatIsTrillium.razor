                    Trillium is a Turing complete language and object-oriented language for implementing and for the execution of the VFX network smart contracts.
                    Trillium smart contracts, also known as SENs (Self-Executing NFTs), are the programs written to create and manage NFTs on the VFX network.

                <br />
                <p>
                    Trillium is a curly-bracket language, but can also execute in a scripting function and is designed to not 
                    need any virtual machine or cluster to execute. It is influenced by C#, JavaScript, and Minsk.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    With Trillium a developer can create NFT driven smart contracts for uses such as royalty enforcement, evolving needs, multi asset collections, 
                    soulboundnd items, and many other utility uses as it is agnostic to use-case entirely.

        <h3 class="h3" style="color:darkturquoise;">How is Trillium Different from other Smart Contract Languages?</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <p>
                The first difference is that it is a language not taken from any current blockchain structures. 
                Trillium was created from multiple resources and with NFTs specifically in mind. 
                It was designed to be light weight and easily executable on a variety of platforms and applications.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                The second big difference is that VFX smart contracts do not require a virtual machine at all.
                They are called Self-Executing NFTs (SENs). These contracts have the ability to dynamically function when called and can modify their 
                returned state without the need to call out or create an expensive transaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another key difference is VFX NFTs IS the smart contract with this language and not a product produced from a smart contract.

        <h3 class="h3" style="color:darkturquoise;">Is Trillium Open Source?</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <p>
                Of course! Trillium, as the case with the VFX network, was written in C#, .net 6, and is on the VFX github.

            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Trillium also has both a desktop and web-based IDE that anyone can test and deploy utilizing the language.
